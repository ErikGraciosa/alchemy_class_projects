# Alchemy Code Lab Foundations I & II and Career Track Mid & Final Projects
Welcome to [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com/)! This is a total collection of the class projects, starting in 2019, until present. 

Our emphasis on process, regular testing and immersive lab sessions allow our grads to understand how their coding works and why it does what it does. As the only engineering education in town that serves Portland and Portland only, combined with in-person training by experienced senior software developers, our grads are real contributors. We stay on top of the most used technologies and aim for our grads to evolve Portland's economy and community through the companies they go to work for.  

## Each cohort completes 4 team-based projects by the time they graduate.
